I wanted to create a simple alternative to commercial products like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) and
[Linkin.bio\*](https://later.com/linkinbio/), which are great, but provide a lot of feautures like scheduling, analytics, and
integrations that I simply don't want or need. Plus in order to get simple customization features with Linktree it'll cost \$72 per year.

I fully support companies charging for their service. And I prefer to pay for digital services rather than suffering ads and companies
dealing/selling personal information...which is why I completley deleted my Facebook Profile in May 2017.

But, I'm a programmer and I can build my own alternative to these services since I don't care about most of their features.

I also wanted to start building little apps/sites using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and this simple little app is perfect.

[Tweet me](https://twitter.com/shanerobinson) or [drop me an email](mailto:shane@shanerobinson.com) if you
have questions about how I built this.
